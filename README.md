# This doc stores random info I refer to.
Sometimes I want to explain a whole thing to someone in an unfitting place, eg in a workshop page description. I use my vault's pages to store various information and just refer to it instead of explaining stuff everywhere. 
It is about creating less work for myself with reexplaining 100 times and about centralizing and organizing knowledge.

Also, you will notice stuff like #stormworks, #coding, etc on most of these pages.
This is because I take notes in Obsidian, (a note taking app I am very fond of) before putting them on github. Obsidian happens to have support for tagging your notes with hashtags and organizing by them, so I make use of that functionality.
